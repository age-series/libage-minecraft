# libage-minecraft

Libage-Minecraft is a minecraft library mod for the Age Series mod.

It requires KFF to run, and most of the Age Series mods depend on this mod.

This mod (will) provide various primitives that allow for various simulations to be used to make Minecraft blocks do even more interesting things.
